### filtering noise miRNA reads
# 
# A read is filtered out if 
#    1)the % of samples having ZERO counts is above the threshold (a fraction)
#    2)the number of samples having ZERO counts is above the threshold (an integer)
#  AND
##   The average read count across SAMPLES is below the cuttoff
# recommended 0.60-0.80 (80%)

# yuo can define the meaning of ZERO, not necessarily 0

ZEROCOUNT_SAMPLE_THRESHOLD=0.60
